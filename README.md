# Personal-Security-Project
This is my 4th Semester for HBO-ICT. I followed a specialization in Cybersecurity and one of the projects I had to make was a PSP (Personal Security Project).

I wanted to build a really simple conceptual version of a digital election system. 
It has some features like caching and rate limiting and is ofcourse projecten against SQLInjection and other web based attacks.
I did a bunch of research into oAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect and used keycloak for the first time to setup external authentication. 
I also did research into keeping the data as anonymous as possible.

Frontend is written in React.js (Typescript) it also uses Mantine.dev for the UI.

Backend is written in ASP.NET 7 (Web Api) and uses MariaDB.

## It doesn't stick to much design concepts and should not be taken as example, I was in a time rush so I only sticked to simple concepts.
